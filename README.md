# Roblox-Custom-Classes
A set of my own libraries I created and use for my Roblox experiences that I decided to open-source to the Roblox community. Most of them are quite bare but the available API should expand over time.

I will be adding classes if I think any of them will fit here. Feel free to use them in any way you wish (except for selling them/claiming they are yours, bla bla)! :)

Currently it's lacking a lot of documentation but I'll hopefully get around to making some - it's just difficult for me to create documentation and keep each little part of it up-to-date! Haha.
